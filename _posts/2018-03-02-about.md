# **Investigating Cognition in Intellectual Disability**

The project is an international collaboration aiming to bring together researchers working on intellectual disability across different institutions in many countries around the world. Together, we will collect data forming a common database enabling a well-powered and comprehensive study of intellectual disability and cognition.  

The core advisory group of the project decides on the main protocol that will be adopted by all participating research groups. All research groups joining the project will have an opportunity to propose additional exploratory research questions resulting in separate publications. The project is currently at the stage of protocol preparation and recruitment of research groups. If you think that this project sounds interesting and you could potentially join us, read on for more information and instructions on how to sign up.

### **Contributors needed:**  
  
We are currently looking for representatives of academic and research institutions across Denmark to join the DKRN and contribute to projects on local and national scale. Our consortium welcomes contributions from researchers at all academic levels from all research disciplines, librarians, lab and research managers, research and academic educators as well as representatives of societies, associations and grant funding organisations. Get in touch with us directly at danish.repro@gmail.com   
  
**A special call for PhD students to help with a journal club**  
We are looking for enthusiastic PhD students to contribute to a Denmark-based [ReproducibiliTea Journal Club](https://reproducibilitea.org/). The journal meetings will be held remotely and we will discuss interdiciplinary papers on matters relating to open, reproducible and transparent research.
