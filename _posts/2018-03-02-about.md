# **Investigating Cognition in Intellectual Disability**

The project is an international collaboration aiming to bring together researchers working on intellectual disability across different institutions in many countries around the world. Together, we will collect data forming a common database enabling a well-powered and comprehensive study of intellectual disability and cognition.  

The core advisory group of the project decides on the main protocol that will be adopted by all participating research groups. 
There are two main studies included in the core protocol:  
* _Developmental trajectories of executive functions and adaptive behaviours in children and young people with intellectual disability._
* _Transdiagnostic profiles of executive functioning and adaptive behaviours in intellectual disability._

<br>   

In addition, our collaborating teams have proposed 8 further studies extending the project's protocol beyond the core aims. These 8 studies will form separate publications.
