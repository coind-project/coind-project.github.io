# **Investigating Cognition in Intellectual Disability**

The project is an international collaboration aiming to bring together researchers working on intellectual disability across different institutions in many countries around the world. Together, we will collect data forming a common database enabling a well-powered and comprehensive study of intellectual disability and cognition.  

**Our Registered Report**  

We have received an in-principle acceptance (IPA) from PCI Registered Reports for a programmatic registered report. The manuscript includes the two core studies and two additional studies, all marked below. To find out more, you can check the [Registered Report IPA](https://rr.peercommunityin.org/articles/rec?id=991) and read [the manuscript](https://osf.io/5cxyw/files/qdsr3).  

**Our 11 Studies** 

The core advisory group of the project agreed on the design for the core protocol that will be adopted by all participating research groups. 
There are two main studies included in the core protocol:  
* _Developmental trajectories of executive functions and adaptive behaviours in children and young people with intellectual disability._
* _Transdiagnostic profiles of executive functioning and adaptive behaviours in intellectual disability._

<br> 

Both are included in the registered report.   

<br>   

In addition to the two core studies, our collaborating teams have proposed 9 further studies extending the project's protocol beyond the core aims. These 9 studies will form separate publications. The following topics will be included:    
* _Daily routines and technological involvement in families of children and adolescents with intellectual disability._ Coordinated by Juan Giraldo-Huertas, Universidad de la Sabana, Colombia & Santiago Alonso, Tecnológico de Monterrey, México.  
* _The Presentation of Emotional Well-Being Across Individuals with an Intellectual Disability._ Coordinated by Caroline G. Richter, University of Alabama at Birmingham, US.  
* _Mastery Motivation Across Individuals with an Intellectual Disability._ Coordinated by Caroline G. Richter, University of Alabama at Birmingham, US.  
* **In the registered report** _General fluid intelligence, Executive functions and their relations to phonological awareness in children with intellectual disability._ Coordinated by Lisa Palmqvist, University of Gothenburg & Karin Nilsson, Linköping University, Sweden.  
* **In the registered report** _Participation, adaptive behaviours, and executive functioning in adolescents with intellectual disability._ Coordinated by Marta Topor and Henrik Danielsson, Linköping University & Karina Huus and Mats Granlund, Jönköping University, Sweden.  
* _Expressive drawing in children with intellectual disability and their relation to child’s mood and development._ Coordinated by Sebastian Unger, Christina Niedermann, Jan P. Röer & Thomas Ostermann, Witten/Herdecke University, Germany.
* _The relationship between number magnitude processing and executive functioning in adolescents with an intellectual disability._ Coordinated by Nina Klang, Anna-Lena Andersson & Helena Tegler, Mälardalen University, Sweden.
* _A Comparison Between Individuals with Intellectual Disability and Typically Developing Peers Matched for Non-Verbal Mental Age in Executive Functions and Adaptive Behavior._ Coordinated by Elisa Rossi, Silvia Lanfranchi & Sara Onnivello, University of Padua, Italy.  
* _Longitudinal Association among Processing Speed, Executive Functions, and Adaptive Behavior in Individuals with Intellectual Disability._ Coordinated by Yoshifumi Ikeda Tokyo Gakugei University, Japan.
