# **Join the Project** 

### **If you have questions about the project**  
Don't hesitate to [contact us on](mailto: marta.topor@liu.se) marta.topor@liu.se if you have any questions about the project.  

### **Who can join the project**  
We are currently looking for teams of researchers who will be able to collect data on cognitive processes in school-aged individuals with intellectual disability.  
In addition to data collection, the joining researchers will have an option to contribute to sub-teams on methodology development, ethics coordination, data analysis and validation.  

**Requirements**  
Research groups interested in contributing to the project’s data collection will delegate at least two people forming Local Data Collection Groups. The Local Data Collection Group should include a PI or a local supervisor as well as at least one person who will conduct the research and collect data from participants. We place no restriction on the number of contributors at the Local Data Collection Group. However, the local PI or supervisor must inform the coordinating team on the number and specific roles and tasks assigned to their local Data Collection Group members. For example, who will be responsible for ethics and who will be responsible for data collection. This should be done right at the point of joining the collaboration and should be updated with the coordination team as soon as any changes take place. Collaboration is decided upon the following conditions:  
  
**The Local Data Collection Group:**
  -	thinks it is feasible (based on e.g. experience) to do data collection involving individuals with intellectual disabilities and using the data collection methods that are selected for the project - [see methodological summary here](https://osf.io/q7p8w)
  -	thinks it is feasible to recruit 25 participants with intellectual disability 
  -	can and will obtain a favourable opinion or approval from a research ethics review committee or an institutional review board. 
  -	can cover the financial expenses associated with staffing and equipment required to conduct data collection (the costs of some tests will be covered by the coordinating team at Linköping University).
  -	can be involved in the project for its expected duration between June 2024 and December 2026. Note, however, that at some periods of time there may be no tasks for the Data Collection Group to complete. 

### **If you are interested**  
You can fill out the [expression of interest form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=7Bg_kSZ_X0yoFnhP6aWO3UcZYQiSE29Ltw8PM9uA3OJURVlIMDEwOFVIQTc5NUJKV0dGNlk5S1NXRy4u). 

Your expression of interest is non-obligatory. It just lets us know that you are interested and possibly able to collect the data as part of the project.  
After you express interest, you will be informed about an onboarding meeting. You will then be able to make a decision as to whether this project is for you or not.
