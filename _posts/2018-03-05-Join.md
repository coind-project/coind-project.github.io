# **Contribution Opportunities** 

### **The Culture of Collaboration and Inclusion**  
We take on a Big Team Science approach with a focus on collaboration and inclusion. All elements of the project, from its very conception, have been driven by collaborative efforts of experts in the field. Therefore, this project presents a fantastic opportunity to contribute to a thoroughly planned and organised programme of research that aims to tackle pressing questions in the field of cognition and intellectual disability. The field currently struggles with issues around methodological heterogeneity and low statistical power. We can overcome these barriers together by joining forces and conducting a study that will have a real impact on the field's development and future direction.  

As a contributor, you will become a co-author on the main publications from the project. So far we predict at least two such publications. In addition, depending on your specific interests, you will have a chance to propose additional research questions or contribute to exploratory studies/analyses that may result in further publications and new collaborations for your team.  

### **If you are interested in the project and consider joining our collaboration**  
We are no longer accepting expressions of interest for potential project collaborators.  
However, there may still be opportunities to contribute depending on which stage of the project we are at. If you are interested and would like to know more, contact us via this email address: coind-project@liu.se. We can arrange a meeting to discuss the project's progress and your potential role as a contributor.
